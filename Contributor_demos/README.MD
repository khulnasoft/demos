## Getting Started

### Step 1: Fill Out the Contributor Form

Before diving into the code, we ask all interested contributors to fill out a short form. This form captures essential information such as your name, email, whether you plan to contribute individually or as part of a group, and the project are you willing to work on. Please complete the form at this link: [Contributor Form](https://forms.gle/kTuRAmLh2SzKmm146). Informations of all the projects are provided in the [Github Projects](https://github.com/orgs/khulnasoft/projects/18). Each project comes with a unique set of challenges and learning opportunities.

### Step 2: Setting up Startai

Once you've filled out the form, you're ready to start contributing to the project of your choice. To get started, follow these steps:
1. Fork the [khulnasoft/demos](https://github.com/khulnasoft/demos) repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
   ```
3. Navigate to the `demos` directory:
   ```bash
    cd demos
    ```
4. Create a new branch for your work:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```
5. Create a virtual environment and install startai(Alternatively, you can set up startai in your local machine using the [official documentation](https://unify.ai/docs/startai/overview/contributing/setting_up.html)):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install startai
    ```
6. Generating API key:
    - Navigate to [KhulnaSoft Console](https://console.unify.ai)
    - Sign up/Log in to your account and create a new key for `Startai Transpiler`
7. Create a new directory `.startai` in the root of the project and create a file `key.pem` inside the `.startai` directory.
8. Paste the API key in the `key.pem` file and save it.
If you have any issues with the setup, please feel free to ask for help on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/sg2QRAvY).

### Step 3: Solving an Issue

Start working on the issue you've chosen. Create a jupyter notebook under the directory of the project you're working on. You can also have the trained model in the same directory.

### Step 4: Submitting Your Pull Request (PR)

After developing your solution, it's time to submit a Pull Request (PR) to the `khulnasoft/demos` repository. Make sure to link the specific issue you're addressing by including `closes <#issue no>.` in your PR description. This notation will help us track which PRs aim to solve which issues.
