Tutorials And Examples
======================

Welcome to Startai's tutorials webpage! Our goal is to provide you with a comprehensive 
learning experience on a variety of topics. We have organized our tutorials into three 
main sections to help you find exactly what you need. 

If you are in a rush, you can jump straight into the `Quickstart <quickstart.ipynb>`_,
a quick and general introduction to Startai's features and capabilities!

- In the **Learn the basics** section, you will find basic and to the point tutorials to
  help you get started with Startai.

- The **Guides** section includes more involved tutorials for those who want to dive 
  deeper into the framework. 

- Finally, in the **Examples and Demos** section, you will find start-to-finish projects
  and applications that showcase real-world applications of Startai. Whether you're a 
  beginner or an advanced user, we've got you covered!
